# üìö Sentiment Analysis on Amazon Kindle Reviews

## üöÄ Project Overview

This project focuses on **Sentiment Analysis** of **Amazon Kindle product reviews**. The goal is to classify user reviews as **Positive** & **Negative**,helping businesses and researchers understand customer satisfaction, trends, and feedback.

By leveraging **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques and **Machine Learning (ML)** models, we extract meaningful insights from unstructured text data and build a robust system that predicts the sentiment of unseen Kindle reviews.

## üìä Dataset

- **Source**: [Amazon Product Review Dataset (Kindle Store)
- **Size**: ~1 million reviews (subset used for this project)
- **Fields**:
  - `reviewText`: The text of the review
  - `overall`: Rating (1-5 stars)
  - `summary`: Short summary of the review
  - `reviewerID`, `asin`, `helpful`, etc.

**Sentiment Labeling**:
- **1-2-3 stars** ‚Üí Negative

- **4-5 stars** ‚Üí Positive
